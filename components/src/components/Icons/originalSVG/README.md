This icon set was created by [Bozlur Rahman](https://www.truelancer.com/freelancer/bozlurrahman), a freelancer in Bangladesh who also created the VizHub logo.

This is the second revision of the custom icon set originally created by [Alec Burch](https://stamen.com/people/alec-burch/), who designed the UI for VizHub 2 during a design engagement with [Stamen Design](https://stamen.com/).
