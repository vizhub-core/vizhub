                Curran quickly understood my complex
                codebase, and was able to fix many of my
                visualization's bugs that I couldn't find
                solutions for online. Additionally, he gave
                specific, best-practice advice to improve
                the load time, UI responsiveness, and
                maintainability of my D3 implementation.
                Curran was great to work with and I would
                100% recommend him to anyone stuck with D3
                bugs, or looking to refactor their code to
                follow best practices.

                  For the past two years, I've relied on
                  VizHub for both my undergraduate and
                  graduate Data Visualization courses.
                  VizHub offers a seamless platform for
                  hosting P5 and D3 code online, providing
                  students with the invaluable ability to
                  make instant changes to their code and
                  observe the results in real-time. This has
                  been a huge hit for my students and me.

                  In my course, students are required to
                  maintain a portfolio of their assignments,
                  and VizHub simplifies this process
                  significantly by allowing them to
                  effortlessly embed their projects onto
                  their personal websites. One of the
                  standout features of VizHub is its ongoing
                  improvement under the diligent guidance of
                  Curran Kelleher, the platform's creator.
                  For example, when I reached out to him
                  about my students running into problems
                  with using P5 on Vizhub, he found a
                  solution and promptly made change to
                  Vizhub to allow my students to use P5. His
                  proactive approach ensures that VizHub
                  remains at the forefront of online
                  solutions for educators and students alike
                  who are keen on exploring and showcasing
                  their visualization projects.
