## Entities

This package defines the "entities" of VizHub.

Corresponds to the "entities" concept from [Clean Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

### Development

As this is the core of the architecture, the `npm test` command just runs Typescript over the files to check validity.
