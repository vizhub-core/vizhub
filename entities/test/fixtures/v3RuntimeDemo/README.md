VizHub V3 is still in early testing and is broken/buggy in many ways.

Please report usability issues to the [VizHub Discord](https://discord.gg/Pn6VY99ba4,).

Thanks for trying this out!

To learn about the patterns in use here that support hot reloading,
see this [video:Vite D3 Hot Reloading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqOQy4BEnqU) and
corresponding code in [GitHub: vite-d3-template](https://github.com/curran/vite-d3-template/tree/main).

## Known usability issues:

- There is no way to delete a viz yet
- Updates to the README only show if you refresh the page
- The code editor expands if there are long lines
- There is no way to resize the editor yet
- Logging in always redirects to the home page
- The "Share" modal is not yet working at all
- There is no way yet to add collaborators to a viz
