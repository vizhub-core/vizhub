# Welcome to VizHub Storybook

This codebase follows the following principles:

- UI is ignorant of (decoupled from) VizHub's `entities` data structures
- UI is decoupled from its app environment, meaning:
  - Links are not really links, but rather callbacks
  - Form submissions are not really form submissions, but rather callbacks
- Based on Bootstrap, so we leverage their utilities where possible
