# Welcome to VizHub Storybook

This codebase follows the following principles:

- UI components in this package should be purely "dumb"
- No application logic should leak into this package
- UI is ignorant of (decoupled from) VizHub's `entities` data structures
- UI is decoupled from its app environment, meaning:
  - Links are not really links, but rather callbacks
  - Form submissions are not really form submissions, but rather callbacks
- Instrument as much as possible for analytics, surfacing additional callbacks
- Based on Bootstrap, so we leverage their features where possible
